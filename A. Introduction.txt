A Brief History of HTML
1991- Tim Berners-Lee invents HTML 1.0
1993- HTML 1.0 is released. Not many developers are creating websites at this time.
1995- HTML 2.0 is published. This contains the features of HTML 1.0 plus new features. This remained the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until 1997.
1997- HTML 3.0 was invented. Here, Dave Raggett introduced a fresh draft on HTML, which improved new features of HTML and gave more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing websites. Unfortunately, the powerful features slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.
1999- The widely-used HTML 4.0 comes out. It is very successful.
2014- HTML 5.0 is released and used worldwide. It is said to be the extended version of HTML 4.01 which was published in 2012.

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language,
It is the standard markup language for creating Web pages, it also describes the structure of a Web page which
consists of a series of elements.These elements tell the browser how to display the content.

A simple HTML Document has this structure
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Page Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>

        <h1>My First Heading</h1>
        <p>My first paragraph.</p>

    </body>
</html>

---The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
---The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
---The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
---The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
---The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
---The <h1> element defines a large heading
