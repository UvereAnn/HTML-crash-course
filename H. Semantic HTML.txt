HTML Layout Elements and Techniques
Websites often display content in multiple columns (like a magazine or a newspaper).

HTML Layout Elements
HTML has several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page:

HTML5 Semantic Elements	
<header> - Defines a header for a document or a section
<nav> - Defines a set of navigation links
<section> - Defines a section in a document
<article> - Defines an independent, self-contained content
<aside> - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
<footer> - Defines a footer for a document or a section
<details> - Defines additional details that the user can open and close on demand
<summary> - Defines a heading for the <details> element

HTML Semantic Elements
Semantic elements = elements with a meaning.
What are Semantic Elements?
A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.
Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.
